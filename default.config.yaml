  # Welcome to Red Handed Poker!

  As the host, you lead the game. Here's what to do:

  1. **Wait for players to join.** Share the player link with them.

  2. **Start the game** when everyone is ready.

  3. **Each round has two phases:**
     - **Betting Phase:** Players place bets based on their hand strength.
     - **Results Phase:** The best hand wins the pot.

  4. **Watch for cheaters!** Players can secretly cheat and accuse others. Discuss with them to determine who's guilty, then punish the cheaters.

  5. **End the game anytime.** Final rankings are determined by each player's gold balance.
